# Falka — Product Backlog

> Companion to [`inventory-mvp.md`](./inventory-mvp.md). The MVP loop (inventory SoT · multi-channel
> orders · POS · purchasing · packing-video evidence · finance foundation) is shipped. This file tracks
> what's **not yet built**, prioritized, with effort + gating so the next pick is a quick decision.
>
> Legend — **Effort**: S (<½ day) · M (1 session) · L (multi-session) · XL (epic). **Gate**: 🟢 none ·
> 🟡 needs a schema migration (HARD CONSTRAINT #1 — confirm first) · 🔴 external dependency (partner /
> API key / WhatsApp approval / strategic decision).

Correctness pack (orders/returns pagination, marketplace token-expiry guard, returns-netting in the
profit report) · inventory-valuation report · share-evidence on order/return dispute panels · manual
order actions (mark-shipped / edit resi / cancel-with-reason) · DAMAGE write-off. Detail in
`inventory-mvp.md` (§13 hardening bullet) + `CLAUDE.md §12`.

- **UI/UX redesign "Suar Dermaga"** (on `main`) — full-brand evolution of the Ombak ledger system:
  sea-glass horizon wash, navy "hull" sidebar, suar attention tokens, `BrandMark` + favicon/og/manifest,
  branded error/404 routes, `StatusBadge`/`ErrorState` primitives, mobile bottom tab bar + card-list
  pattern, maritime empty-state art, and the **Pandu** assistant pattern (honest stub: deterministic
  nudges + keyword router, permanent "Pratinjau" label). Detail in `.cursor/rules/50-ui-design-system.mdc`
  - `docs/roadmap/falka-redesign.md` + memory `falka-redesign-suar-dermaga`.
- **Kasir & Pesanan pack** (on `main`) — orders list search + status filter; products list pagination;
  marketplace per-connection sync-health badges; below-cost flag at sale-create; `grup · subvarian`
  picker label; 0-quota storage display fix.
- **Discount + PPN at POS** (on `main`) — per-cart discount (% / fixed) + PPN (inclusive/exclusive);
  `Sale`/`SaleItem` net fields; shared `sale-totals` util (POS preview == server); profit report reads
  net; printable struk + CASH kembalian calculator.
- **Partial / per-item POS refund** (branch `feat/pos-partial-refund`) — `SaleRefund`/`SaleRefundItem` +
  `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`; restock per qty; refunds net the profit report; VOID refused once a refund exists.
- **Dead-stock & ABC analysis** (branch `feat/dead-stock-abc-report`) — read-only `reporting` report at
  `/dashboard/reports/dead-stock` (two `?tab`-synced lenses). Dead-stock: in-stock variants idle past an
  idle-days threshold (real days-since-last-sale from the `SALE`/`ORDER_RESERVE` ledger, or age when never
  sold), capital valued at moving-average cost. ABC: SKUs ranked by net revenue and bucketed A/B/C by
  cumulative share (Pareto, over positive revenue so return-heavy SKUs fall to C). Pure aggregates + 9 unit
  tests; CSV export each; no schema change. Distinct from the reorder report's coarse age-proxy `DEAD` flag.
- **Stock opname / cycle count** (branch `feat/dead-stock-abc-report` → opname commits on `main`) —
  `StockOpname`/`StockOpnameItem` + `StockOpnameStatus` (DRAFT/COMPLETED/CANCELLED). A session at
  `/dashboard/inventory/opname`: scan/type or search to add a line (system qty snapshotted at add), edit the
  counted qty inline with a live variance, then **post** → each line's variance writes a `RECONCILE`/`MANUAL`
  ledger row via a new `applyReconcileTx` and corrects the Inventory cache (then propagates), or cancel.
  Posted/cancelled sessions render read-only as the variance report. **Phase 2 (shipped):** an `OPNAME`
  `PairingPurpose` + `useOpnameScanner` so a paired phone (or the manual field) **tallies +1 per scan**
  (`scanCountItem` resolves + increments atomically; `POST …/opname/:id/scan`); the search picker still
  sets counted to the system qty. Socket.IO contracts unchanged.

- **Organization / team RBAC foundation** (big-bet G) + the **"Falka Live" hardening** (storage-quota
  blocker, deploy boot blockers, middleware auth-gating fix, cross-tenant probe) — on `main`. See
  `org-foundation.md` + memory `olshop-falka-live`.
- **Lazada Open Platform — real OAuth multi-seller integration** (branch `session/lazada-integration`,
  13 commits, gates + `pnpm build` green, OAuth flow tested through the UI). Each org connects its own
  Lazada shop via OAuth (authorize + public callback with an encrypted `state`); token refresh +
  test-connection routes/buttons; import (`/products/get`) live-validated + auto-map; stock-push
  payload fixed to **ItemId+SkuId** (Lazada deprecated `SellerSku`); worker E501 made non-retryable.
  Signer/client/payload/token helpers live in `@falka/marketplace-providers`. **Stock-WRITE is blocked
  by a Lazada seller-eligibility/dropshipping-warehouse rule, not Falka code.** Detail + the Lazada-side
  gotchas: `.cursor/rules/40-inventory-marketplace.mdc` (Lazada OAuth section) + memory
  `olshop-lazada-integration`. **Stock-WRITE unblocked 2026-06-15** — switched to
  `/product/stock/sellable/update` (POST + XML, **absolute** `SellableQuantity`), the path
  dropshipping-warehouse sellers can call; live-validated `code:0` + read-back. (The `/adjust` sibling is a
  DELTA — not for sync.) The scheduled refresh worker also shipped (Phase 6).
  **Deferred:** multi-region per-connection gateway (needs a migration).

## ✅ Shipped (2026-06-15)

- **Phase 6 — provider-health dashboard + drift reconciliation + token auto-refresh** (mid-size #2 +
  big-bet B's scheduled-refresh tail) — on branch `session/2026-06-15-phase6-reconciliation`. **Zero DB
  migration** (drift computed on-read, health from existing fields), **observe-only** (internal stock
  stays the SoT; drift is surfaced, fixes are a manual re-push). Web: `marketplaceHealthService`
  (per-connection ok/warn/danger from token lifecycle + sync coverage + needs-review + failed pushes +
  recent sync), `marketplaceReconciliationService.checkDrift` (live pull → `computeStockDrift` →
  over/under/missing), `GET /marketplaces/health` + `/[id]/health` (marketplace.view) + `POST
/[id]/drift-check` (marketplace.manage); a "Kesehatan & drift" panel + dashboard badges + a
  `marketplaceUnhealthy` nav pulse. Worker: `reconcile-marketplace-drift` (daily, logs drift per active
  connection) + `refresh-marketplace-tokens` (daily, renews Lazada tokens nearing expiry), sharing the
  `MARKETPLACE_RECONCILE` queue. `computeStockDrift` + the drift/token data-access live in `@falka/queue`
  (web + worker share them); `fetchLazadaListings` lifted to `@falka/marketplace-providers`. Detail in
  `inventory-mvp.md` Phase 6 + `.cursor/rules/40-inventory-marketplace.mdc`. **Deferred:** a persistent
  drift audit-log + configurable alert thresholds, OAuth callbacks for the other providers.

Push writes `available` to ONLY that warehouse (single-entry `<MultiWarehouseInventories>`, inner `<Quantity>`) and **OMITS the rest — Lazada leaves omitted warehouses untouched** (partial update, live-verified); never zeroes a warehouse we don't own. Drift compares `available` vs the sync warehouse's own sellable (`resolveSyncWarehouseStock`), not the sum. null = bare single-warehouse path (unchanged). The internal multi-location/WMS generalization (this is its n=1 case) is scoped separately in `docs/roadmap/wms-scoping.md`. Found + fixed 2026-06-16. |

## ⚡ Quick wins (sub-hour)

- **Bulletproof per-listing sync completion feedback** (marketplace) — today a manual sync
  (syncNow / "Sinkron semua") shows a "sinkronisasi berjalan" state by polling the connection's
  in-flight sync-job count every 2s; for a real Lazada push (≥300ms) this reliably reflects
  completion, but an ultra-fast (dev-stub) job can finish before the first poll, so the drift
  table's auto-recheck may be skipped. Make it deterministic per listing: after a click, watch
  the SPECIFIC job/mapping to a terminal state (poll `lastSyncStatus`/`lastSyncedAt`, or push a
  job-done event over the socket) and show definite success/fail per row. Deferred 2026-06-16
  (works well enough for real Lazada; the gap is dev-stub-only).
- _(No other open quick wins — all of the below shipped to `main`.)_
- _(shipped 2026-06-11: marketplace sync-health badge · below-cost alert at sale-create ·
  `grup · subvarian` picker label.)_
- _(shipped 2026-06-12: `@@index([userId, createdAt])` on `StockLedger` — serves the userId-scoped
  newest-first activity-log scans the reason-prefixed index can't order.)_
- _(shipped 2026-06-12: archived-variant view + restore on product detail — a collapsible
  "Varian terarsip" section lists soft-deleted variants; restore un-mangles the original SKU and
  is refused when a live variant/bundle now owns it.)_
- _(shipped 2026-06-12: bundle archive — `Bundle.deletedAt` soft-delete (manual delete now archives,
  restorable); deleting a variant warns if it's a bundle component, then on confirm drops it from
  every live bundle and auto-archives any bundle left empty; "Bundel terarsip" view + restore.)_
